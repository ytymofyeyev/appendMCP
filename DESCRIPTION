Description:
    appendMCP provides routines for describing graphical multiple comparison
    procedures (MCP) in group sequential design (GSD) studies. The objective is
    to generate an R Markdown file that defines the MTP and interim analyses,
    which can be appended to a statistical analysis plan document.
    The package provides predefined templates that can be modified by a user, 
    ideally by changing only high-level input parameters.
